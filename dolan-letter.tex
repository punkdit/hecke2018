% Letter body

Please find attached a resume 
for the mathematician \emph{James Dolan},
as well as 
two letters of recommendation written by
John Baez and Todd Trimble.

I have been working/learning/collaborating with James
since 2017. He is a big source of inspiration and ideas
for the work I do at Quantinuum and it only seems reasonable 
that he is actually employed as a consultant or otherwise
by Quantinuum. I'm sure others will also benefit from
interacting with James, and that his experience in number
theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry
will play a role in the design of our quantum computers.

% Closing statement
\closing{Many thanks,}

\end{letter}
